This repository contains the exercises -- 1, 2, and 3 -- for chapter 7 from the Principles and Practice Using C++, 2nd Edition.


User's Guide for all exercises:

    To input calculations (e.g., +, -, *, /, %), you input your formula followed by a semicolon. Then, hit enter.
    Example: "2+3;"

    You can create variables and use them in calculations. Put "let ", your variable name, "=", and then the numerical value you want to set the variable equal to, 
    which is then followed by a semicolon. Then, hit enter.
    Example: "let variable=5;"
    
    You can find the square root for numerical values as well as variables. Put "sqrt" and then, in parentheses, the number or variable you want to find the square 
    root of, which is then followed by a semicolon.
    Example: "sqrt(9);"
    
    If you want to exit the program, type "exit" and hit enter.

Additional User's Guide for ex01:

    When you enter a new variable, the variable can contain underscores (i.e., "_"). The program will work the same otherwise.

Additional User's Guide for ex02:

    When you enter a new variable, the variable can contain underscores (i.e., "_").
    
    You can set a new value for a variable and use them in calculations. Put "= ", the variable that you want to change the value of, "=", and then the new numerical value
    you want to set the variable equal to.

Additional User's Guide for ex03:

    When you enter a new variable, the variable can contain underscores (i.e., "_").
    
    You can set a new value for a variable and use them in calculations. Put "= ", the variable that you want to change the value of, "=", and then the new numerical value
    you want to set the variable equal to.
    
    You can set a variable as constant and use them in calculations. Put "const ", the variable that you want to become constant, "=", and then the numerical value
    you want to set the variable equal to.
